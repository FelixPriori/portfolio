			'After graduating from Lighthouse Labs in April 2020, I landed a job at Webisoft, a small web agency startup based in Montréal. I was tasked to maintain, and build all of their React.js applications, which involved working on a long-standing app, an app which was just about ready to launch, and a new app in its infancy. The small size of the company and the different scopes for each project meant I had to learn how to adapt to a new environment quickly and independently.',

			'At Nventive, I was part of a larger company with amazing devs to learn from. I worked on various projects, learning new technologies along the way such as Vue.js, TypeScript, and very briefly C# / ASP.NET Core.

			'I was recruited at the beginning of 2022 to work for Nurun, a veteran web agency which has a ton of projects from a wide range of industries around the world. I worked for impressive clients such as Hydro-Québec, Cadillac, Grant Thornton, and ADMTL just to name a few. I had to adapt to new technologies, projects, and teams quickly as I was needed to jump from one project to another, while still having to maintain the highest possible code quality. While still doing the majority of my work in React.js and TypeScript, I had to learn technologies on the fly such as: GraphQL, Strapi, Storybook, CraftCMS, Stencil, and Twig just to name a few. Their emphasis on accessibility had me work closely with a WCAG expert, making sure that applications met WCAG 2.0 accessibility standards.',
