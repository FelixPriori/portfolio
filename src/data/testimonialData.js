Throughout my time working with him, Felix was helpful, patient, friendly, and extremely knowledgeable. Through discussions and pair-programming he helped me to understand important programming concepts in simple terms; lessons that I can now carry forward into a web development career with confidence. Felix would be an invaluable asset to any front-end development team.',
